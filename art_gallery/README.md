# WEBD 5000 - Exercise 16

 ## Instructions:  

Open this repository in the default GitHub Codespace as shown in class.
- Add the Live Server extension to VS Code as shown in class.
- When satisfied that you have completed all the required changes to the repository folder, **commit & push** the entire folder's contents up to GitHub as shown in class. 
- You must ensure that your solution has been pushed to GitHub in order to get credit for the exercise.  

### Part A

Go to the [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) application.

It would be ideal to complete all the chapters, but you must leave yourself enough time to do the textbook activity below. So, try to complete at least 8 chapters and copy a screenshot into this repository showing successful completion of the tasks.

NOTE: AT SOME POINT YOU MAY ALSO WANT TO COMPLETE [Grid Critters](https://gridcritters.com/)

### Part B: Tutorial 5 Case Problem 2 (HTML 448)

#### Important Note #1: 
There is an element in the rubric that deals with Chapter 4 material not covered in the textbook instructions, so **for full marks you will need to add a gradient style to the site**. You can pick a different element to add a gradient to, or follow my example in the screenshot below where a pink-to-white linear gradient was applied to the entire page background for the desktop version of the site.


####  Important Note #2: 

You must **ensure that your solution has been committed & pushed to GitHub at least three times** while working on the assignment (i.e. at different stages of completion) in order to get credit for the assignment.  

### Tasks:  

Complete Case Problem #2 from Tutorial 5 on page **HTML 448**(Section 5-21g) of the textbook.
